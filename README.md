# Call-Center-Analysis
This visualization was created using Power BI

As a manager of a call center organization, what are the core KPIs you would be interested to know about the performance of your agents from your monthly data?

I created this dashboard to answer the following questions:
1. Number of customers attended to in Q1
2. Call resolution
3. Customer Satisfaction Rate
4. Average duration of calls
5. Agents' performance quadrant
